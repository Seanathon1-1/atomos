A physics simulation project I have working on in my spare time. Currently simulates a bunch of colored balls with gravity. Physics is enforced via continuous collision detection to balance speed and accuracy. Uses a grid-based data structure and multithreading to optimize collision checks. My goal for this is to have the balls be able to fill up the screen.

This project used the biolerplate framework provided by u/litasa, Jakob Törmä, for GLEW/GLFW implementation.
